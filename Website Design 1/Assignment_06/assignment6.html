<p>       This entire process was very cool. It was a new way of showing inspiration                that I hadn't experienced before. Normally, we don't see our classmates'
           inspiration until the very end of a project, once we present our final completed spaces.
           This process feels more interactive and I think that at the end of this project, we will all have a greater appreciation for one another's projects because weâ€™ve spent more of this journey conversing and being engaged with one another.
