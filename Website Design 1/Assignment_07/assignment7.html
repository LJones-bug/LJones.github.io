        My final project will be closely related to the videogame franchise                                “Five Nights At Freddy’s or FNAF for short. The game appeared in 2014 hitting YouTube gamer pages not soon after, including Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and a personal favorite of mine CoryxKenshin. This boosted the popularity of the game, however, the game also helped popularize the Youtubers. The original FANAF is described as a “Point and click survival horror game” It was developed by                   Scott Cawthon and stretches to almost any platform.

        In the original game, you play as a security guard in Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria which contains 4 animatronics Freddy, Bonny, Chica, and Foxy, all of the animatronics can operate on their own however they can also be worn as suits.

        In the game the animatronics come to “life” and their goal is to end the player's life (the security guard). The player's goal is to keep them away by closing electronic doors, using cameras connected to a tablet and lights controlled by switches, the catch is that you only have limited power so the doors cannot stay closed cameras cant be viewed all night, and the lights cannot stay on.
