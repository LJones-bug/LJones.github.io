            <h4>Whats New</h4>
        <p>
            
           “Moana 2” is now out in theaters! One of Disney's newest films hit theaters November 27th 2024. Theres only one problem a lot of fans are unhappy with the production; apparently Moana 2 was never meant to be viewed as a movie, the film was originally meant to be released on Disney+ as a miniature series that follows up on our characters Moana, Maui, Hei Hei, Pua, and the rest of the village. However it has been speculated that Disney+ hasn’t been doing so well financially so releasing a movie was thought to be a better move.

           I personally think the movie was phenomenal, I understand some of the frustration however at the end of the day it's all really for the kids. So have you seen Moana 2, what are your thoughts?

            Speaking of Disney+ mini series, following the release of “Inside Out 2” ( June 14th 2024 ) there will be a series about the ones responsible for putting together Riley’s dreams behind the scenes. It’ll be called “Dream Productions”, it's directed and written by Mike Jones and is set to be released on December 11th 2024, will you be there?
