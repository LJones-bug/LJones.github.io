          <p>We must remember him... </p>
          
       <p>
          Walter Elias Disney was an American animator, film producer, voice actor, and entrepreneur. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film producer, he holds the record for most Academy Awards earned and nominations by an individual.
          </p>
          
          <p>All of this is for him.. Walter, he died so long ago, however those in charge want to bring him back, they want his mind most of all.
          </p>
          
          <p>The business is declining, slowly but still. To continue to be sucssefull the plan is to resurrect
him. This isn't their only goal they want to bring him back as a test..
          </p>
          
          <p>This, no he is an experiment a test for the rest. This is not done out of sympathy.. if THEY succeed he wont be a success but a victom of a future that he was not aware was even possible...</p>
