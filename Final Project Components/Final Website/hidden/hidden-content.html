 It turns out that Disney has been practicing questionable rituals and methods to bring back
 Walt Disney himself, however, these have all been failed attempts, rather than the dark
 nature of their actions being directed at their dear leader it has affected the animatronics. At
 first causing small malfunctions, leaks, and broken parts, but later causing animatronics to
 moveandfunction all on their own, performing actions that went far beyond their
 programming.

<section id="p2">
 Around the sametimeasthese mysterious rituals security guards and other Disney
 employees started to go missing, one being a very close friend of mine. This is why I started
 myinvestigations I started just by going to various theme parks and attractions related to
 Disney looking for any clues that could give me a lead, I kept searching for months but I
 couldn't find anything. I only had one place left to visit before I made somewhat of a
 breakthrough, it was dumb and I didn't think anything could come from it… I went to Chicago
 Illinois to visit the Museum of Science and Industry where Walt’s mechanical bird was
 displayed. Whilst there I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching me I
 searched and analyzed the faces of those around me but I couldn't find anyone this is when I
 saw the bird from the corner of my eye watching me, I froze, without making eye contact
 with it I walked around pretending to look at other things around the museum but it
 continued to watch me. This is when I realized the lead I needed was right under my nose.

 The animatronics froze in place, seeming to vomit fuel, the ones that shake violently aren't
 malfunctions… or at least normal ones… they are being affected by something… and it's
 something dangerous, judging by the range of animatronics and distance between theme
 parks whatever it is it's strong...
