        After reading the essay by Kate Wagner, I can say that I did enjoy seeing her feelings toward the internet and having a heavy focus on its different eras as she grew up with it.I did find some subsections more interesting than others the introduction part of the essay was my favorite, but some parts I did not like as much nor did I agree with or think were true such as in the section titled “The Hell Of Beautiful Interfaces” seemed very long and wordy to me. There were a few times when I found myself losing focus while reading it. There's also the section “Revenge Of The Old Internet?” she talks about how Facebook is slowly dying and how it's going to be like “MySpace”.

To start I want to go through why I believe that a pretty big chunk of the “Revenge Of The Old Internet?” is something that I don't completely agree with. She talks about how a large part of Facebook users have stopped using it because it's “so high school” or “so middle school” There are two things about this that make me oppose these one being completely opinion based as well. I believe that if anyone were to assume the age range of the individuals that use Facebook I feel as though it would be the older generation. I have even heard numerous jokes that Facebook is an “old person app”. However, despite that I have seen that Facebook is making a come back. It's adapting and keeping up with apps that “young people” are more active on like Tiktok and Instagram, it also has close connections to the metaverse ( the metaverse is typically paired with the phrase “Future of digital connections” ) and this is more so popular with younger folk.

I enjoyed the opening or introductory section of the essay the most. I was hit with a sort of moment of realization when she started to talk about how her earliest memory of the internet was when she was five, and she then proceeded to do a timeline of her life alongside the growth of the internet and she continues to do this throughout the rest of the essay but I think that this is a wholesome attention grabber for a reader that did not have the same nor similar experience. 

Another thing that I took note of during the reading is that Ms. Wanger is not too happy with the idea of the internet growing and becoming more advanced. This does not come from a place of hate or negativity but more so from sadness or missing what once was. When she talks about the nostalgia she gets from looking through Instagram stickers and GIFs it made me think about how those things don't spark the same emotions within me, I just think of them as being an aesthetic visual to add to my post. I also got to wondering whether the same people who share the same experiences and who are within the same age brackets as the writer are the same ones developing the apps and digital accessories. 

Also, this is something that bugged me a little. Ending the essay off with b**ch was very unnecessary and could have been left out, I guess that it does slightly fit the theme of the subsection  “Revenge Of The Old Internet?” I think it's meant to be rebellious.
This concludes my response, overall I did enjoy becoming more aware of how the Internet affected and continues to affect different generations.
